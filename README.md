# Introduction

Gemini Health wants to improve efficiency of operation. The project contributes to this goal by analyzing and predicting the Length of Stay of the patients, as well as giving instruction to shorten Length of Stay. 

## What is the LOS 

Length of Stay is how long a patient stays at the hospital in a single episode of hospitalization. Inpatient days are calculated by subtracting day of admission from day of discharge.

## Why analyzing, predicting and shortening LOS importance & value

Analyzing, predicting and shortening Length of Stay help to improve efficiency of hospital operation from 3 different aspects, operation efficiency, patient safety and patient satisfaction. 

First, for hospital operation, this project helps to track key metrics, take actions accordingly and get more profit. 

There’s acute Length of Stay to Expected Length of Stay Ratio, which is the key metric. A ratio greater than 1 indicates acute stay was longer than expected, indicating potential inefficiency; While a ratio below 1 indicates the acute stay was shorter than expected, which is efficient, given patients are discharged safely. When it’s inefficient, hospital managers will further investigate into root cause and take actions accordingly to make it better - in other words, shorten the Length of Stay. 

The actions to shorten the Length of Stay include optimizing the discharge process (The smoother the discharge process, the faster the patients will be discharged, which is a shorter stay); Standardizing the treatment by training nurses and doctors so that the patients can recover faster with better treatment; Allocating health service resource better (For example, schedules for nurses and cleaning staffs can be arranged in advance); Identifying patients with prolonged LOS and find a solution (For example, some patients keep staying at hospital as long as possible just because they don‘t have a house to live in. This project helps hospital managers to figure out the unnecessary stays and find a solution for them). 

Shorter Length of Stay is desirable in each hospital because it creats good amount of value for the hospital by increasing hospital capacity as well as cutting cost of care delivery. 


Second, from aspect of patient safety, this project helps hospitals to lower risk of infection and reduce cost of treatment for patients. For example, a patient predicted as a long-stay patient with infectious disease at admission will be sent to a higher-level ward and limit his or her number of visitors, so that the patients in general are kept away from infection. This will save cost for both hospital and patients. 


Third, from the aspect of patient satisfaction, this project helps improve it so that hospitals can win more customers and make more profit. For example, beds and rooms in a hospital are valuable and limited resource. If a patient cannot get a bed right now, at least he or she can be told how many days need to wait. Then the patient is more likely to come back to this hospital at the estimated date if their condition permits. Additionally, with shorter LOS and better discharge process, patient can get home earlier and have a better experience with a hospital. 

Therefore, this project helps hospitals to improve operation, patient safety and satisfaction, and create good amount of value. 

## This project is NOT to…

When accuracy reaches a threshold, the timeliness wins over accuracy rate. For example, 80% accuracy available now is better than 95% accuracy in 1-month later. Additionally, analyzing and predicting of Length of Stay is an ongoing process instead of one-time thing, keeping iterating for each patient. 

## Transferred value in future

With such huge importance and value, Length of Stay is not only used in hospitals, but also applicable to other industries, such as entertainment, event marketing, trade show and leisure. Length of Stay is used to determine the length of time an attendee is expected to spend on a site or in a venue and is part of the calculation used to determine the gross sales potential for selling space to vendors. And affects everything from parking to sanitation, staffing and food and beverage. That’s the transferred value of this project in future.
